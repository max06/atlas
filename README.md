**Application Topology Layer Across Systems**

Navigate your GitOps deployments across any cluster topology with hierarchical inheritance.

**Disclaimer:**

- Claude and grok (their web-versions) were used to save some time finding logical errors and to create code comments.
- No "agent" ever had direct access to the code, or was left unattended.

And I prefer to keep it that way.
